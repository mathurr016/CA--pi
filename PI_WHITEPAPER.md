# Pi Whitepaper

## Introduction

The Pi Network is a new cryptocurrency and smart contract platform that aims to provide a more inclusive and accessible digital currency for everyday people. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Pi can be mined on mobile devices without draining battery or using excessive data.

## Vision

Pi Network's vision is to build the world's most inclusive peer-to-peer economy, powered by Pi, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency.

## Key Features

- **Mobile Mining**: Pi can be mined on mobile devices without draining battery or using excessive data.
- **User & Developer Friendly**: Pi Network aims to create a user-friendly and developer-friendly ecosystem.
- **Security**: Pi Network uses a consensus algorithm based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to ensure security and scalability.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Design, Distribution, Trust Graph Bootstrap

- The Pi server is operating as a faucet emulating the behavior of the decentralized system as it will function once it is live. During this phase, improvements in user experience and behavior are possible and relatively easy to make. All coin minting is being done on the centralized Pi server.

### Phase 2: Testnet

- Before we launch the mainnet, the node software will be deployed on the testnet. The testnet will use the same trust graph as the mainnet, but on a testing Pi coin. Pi Network will host several nodes on the testnet, but will encourage more Pioneers to start their own nodes on the testnet.

### Phase 3: Mainnet

- Once the community feels the software is ready, and it has been thoroughly tested on the testnet, the official mainnet of the Pi network will be launched. During this phase, only accounts validated to belong to real distinct individuals will be honored. After this point, faucet and Pi Network emulator will be shut down, and the system will continue on its own forever.

## Conclusion

Pi Network aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. By allowing users to mine Pi on their mobile devices, Pi Network is creating a more inclusive and accessible digital currency. Join the Pi Network today and start mining Pi on your mobile device!
